            <div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>In this health note we&rsquo;re going to&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>talk more fully&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>about how and why housing is impacting our resilience through COVID-19, why it is contributing to health inequities, and what that means for us</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>When we think of healthy housing, we may initially think of the quality of the physical structure someone lives in</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;But housing is so much more</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;than the sum of a shelter&rsquo;s construction materials</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>For example,&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>does&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>someone lives in a home with&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<ul>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Extreme temperatures or&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>water&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>and energy&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>leaks</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>?</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>If so, they&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>may be more likely to experience chronic and respiratory conditions like asthma,&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>cancer,&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>car</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>d</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>iovascular disease, and COPD</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
          <div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Features of substandard housing&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>quality,&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>such as excessive moisture and dampness, inadequate or poorly maintained heating and ventilation systems, crowding, pest infestations, deteriorated carpeting, and structural defects are associated with</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;lowered immunity and</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;exposure to&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>respiratory infections</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>In addition to housing quality, stable housing is an important factor in health equity because being without stable housing can be detrimental to one&rsquo;s health. Not only do people who are chronically homeless face lower life expectancy and higher morbidity in physical and mental health</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>People who experience housing insecurity are more likely to experience poor health in comparison to their stably housed peers</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>For example, when someone&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>falls behind on rent,&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>...it can increase&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>chronic stress, which can suppress the effects of the immune system. Additionally,</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;housing instability&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>can result in disruptions to employment, social support networks, education, proper storage of medications, and the receipt of social service benefits</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Residential instability like eviction or foreclosures can lead to an increase in depression, anxiety,&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>and&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>alcohol use. It is also associated with health problems among youth, including increased risks of teen pregnancy, early substance use, and depressive symptoms.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Residential crowding has also been linked to both psychological distress and physical illness (for example, the spread of infectious disease).</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>According to MHC&rsquo;s 2019 housing report, approximately 23 percent of homeowners with a mortgage and approximately 45 percent of renter households in Louisville spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing between 2000 and 2017.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Some families were even &ldquo;severely cost-burdened,&rdquo; meaning they spent more than 50 percent of their income on housing. The &ldquo;cost burden&rdquo; associated with having to spend most of your income on housing often leaves little money for o</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>ther living expenses, like food and</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;utilities, let alone access to other health-related amenities such as educational expenses, recreational programs, or healthcare. Much of this burden is more likely to fall upon renters rather than homeowners</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>This means that families who experience the financial strain of having difficulty paying mortgages or rent are more likely to postpone medical treatment when they need it.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Nationally, severely cost-burdened renters are 23 percent more likely than those with less severe burdens to face difficulty purchasing food. Homeowners who are behind in their mortgage payments are also more likely to lack a sufficient supply of food and to go without prescribed medications, compared to those who do not fall behind on payments</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Researchers have found that the availability of resources such as public transportation to one&rsquo;s job, grocery stores with nutritious foods, and safe spaces to exercise are all correlated with improved health outcomes. Neighborhood characteristics such as living in residentially segregated areas or near high-volume roads, however, can be a danger to health and can result in increased rates of respiratory diseases such as asthma and bronchitis and increased use of health care</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Because of Louisville&rsquo;s history of redlining, in which the federal government made it legal for banks and insurance companies to deny black families access to loans, devalue their homes, and forced them to live in segregated neighborhoods; today&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>over 75% of the Louisville&rsquo;s Black population lives on less than 5% of the land</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>. Because that land isn&rsquo;t within proximity of living wage jobs or nutritious food, and is more likely to be located near industries that pollute the land, water, and air, we see many inequitable health outcomes in market areas that correspond with the Louisville&rsquo;s racially and economically segregated areas.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>What can we do?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>To start, there are 3 different actions we can all take to</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>day.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>1) Address the root cause of health outcomes</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>2) Understand how the systems of power (e.g. racism, classism, ableism)&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>have&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>shaped the</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>se</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;root cause</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>s</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>3) Work together to develop interventions that repair the harm created by segregation policies and institutional practices</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>What do we mean by &ldquo;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Address the root cause of health outcomes</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>?&rdquo;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>If you&rsquo;re comfortable with doing so, I want to paint a picture for you.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Imagine a tree.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>When we see trees, we usually judge its health by those leaves you&rsquo;re picturing. Whether the leaves are full or few. This is&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>similar to</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;our own health as people, we&rsquo;re judged by the health outcomes we experience. That&rsquo;s everything from&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>diabetes</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;to drug use.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>This is why</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;we say it&rsquo;s helpful to think about our health outcomes as the leaves in the tree.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>But,</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;we know that our health does not start with those outcomes. Just like the health of a tree doesn&rsquo;t start with those leaves. So, if we want to understand the health of the people we serve, we need to understand the roots. And for people, those are called root causes to our health.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>This includes</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;access to&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>health</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>y</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>, stable, and affordable</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;housing</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>, access to living wage jobs and transportation, food access, etc</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>What we know is that we see patterns in health outcomes across Jefferson County because we see patterns in how people experience root causes. So, as public health folks, we&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>have to</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;ask a question. Why? Why do we see patterns in how people experience root causes? Because we all experience them. Right? We all experience housing, schools, or the health care system. But, how and how well&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>we do so&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>shapes</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;what our health looks like.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>So why do we see differences in the way people experience housing stability,</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;the</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;resources in their&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>neighborhoods</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>, or&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>in&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>housing quality?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>That brings us to our second point.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
		  <div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Understand how the systems of power &lsquo;in the soil&rsquo; (e.g. racism, classism, ableism) shaped housing and t</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>hese root causes</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>So</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;we like to take this metaphor a step further and say the soil that the tree is planted in shapes the conditions of the roots and the eventual leaves. In this metaphor, the soil are&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>all of</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;our systems of power.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>Power is the ability to achieve a purpose.&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Systems of power impact the design of and experience with root causes, including what how it is resourced and what it is resourced to do.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>We can see power through&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>strategies like&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>agenda setting, mobilizing around an action, and influencing perspective and world view.</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>Whether or not power is good or bad depends upon the purpose.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>A person can</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>:</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>exercise a sense of agency by voting or participating in the political process</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span>hold positional power over</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;another&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>or choose to&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>redistribute</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>&nbsp;that power to work&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-US"><span>WITH others</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
